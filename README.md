# DQN for bananas

## Getting Started


### Intro
For this project, you will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.

### Reward 
A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

### State space
The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

### Action space
0 - move forward.
1 - move backward.
2 - turn left.
3 - turn right.

### Goal
The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.
